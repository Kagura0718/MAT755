\section{SUMMARY}
In this project, we investigate the connection between normal habits and degrees of obscenity. We discuss various clustering techniques as well as ways to choose the right number of clusters. We select 7 clusters from Ward's method-based agglomerative clustering and 5 clusters from the partitioning around medoids clustering as our final model after applying them and evaluating the performance of various models. Finally, we discuss how specific clusters link to the prevalence of obesity. The following effort will involve looking more closely at them, contrasting those two models, and attempting to determine the final pattern of how those behaviors link to obesity levels.
